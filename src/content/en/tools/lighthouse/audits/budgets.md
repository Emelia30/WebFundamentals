After putting in the hard work of improving your site performance, use a *performance budget* to prevent
your site performance from regressing over time.

The **Keep Request Counts And File Sizes Small** audit lists the total number of requests
and file size of scripts, images, and so on. This
audit is available in all Lighthouse runtime environments.

You can define a budget file to impose explicit limits on some or all of these resource types. After defining
your budget file the new **Over Budget** column tells you whether you're exceeding any of your self-defined limits.

When you define a budget file, the **Performance Budgets** audit reports on the resource types that you've specified.
But you can still access the information for the rest of the types from the **Keep Request Counts And File Sizes Small**
audit.

## Setup {: #setup }

Follow the instructions below to configure Lighthouse to report when you're over budget. As mentioned
before, this is only possible when running Lighthouse from the command line. The **Keep Request Counts
And File Sizes Small** audit is always available in all Lighthouse runtime environments and requires no configuration.

### Define a budget file {: #define }

By convention the budget file is usually called `budget.json` but you can call it whatever you like.
The example below sets the following budgets:

* 125 kilobytes for all scripts
* 50 kilobytes for all stylesheets
* 100 network requests total

```json
[
  {
    "path": "/",
    "resourceSizes": [
      {
        "resourceType": "script",
        "budget": 125
      },
      {
        "resourceType": "stylesheet",
        "budget": 50
      }
    ],
    "resourceCounts": [
      {
        "resourceType": "total",
        "budget": 100
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The table below describes each of the `budget.json` properties.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Valid Value(s)</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>path</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>
        A path pattern adhering to the
        <a href="/search/reference/robots_txt#url-matching-based-on-path-values">robots.txt format</a>.
      </td>
      <td>
        The <code>resourceSizes</code> and <code>resourceCounts</code> budgets apply to all
        pages matching this pattern.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>resourceSizes</code></td>
      <td>Array</td>
      <td>
        An array of objects. Each object must have a <code>resourceType</code> and <code>budget</code> property.
      </td>
      <td>
        The <code>budget</code> value specifies the total size limit in kilobytes for the category that's specified
        in <code>resourceType</code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>resourceCounts</code></td>
      <td>Array</td>
      <td>

        in <code>resourceType</code>.

    <tr>
      <td><code>resourceType</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>
        <code>total</code>, <code>document</code>, <code>script</code>, <code>stylesheet</code>, <code>image</code>,
        <code>media</code>, <code>font</code>, <code>other</code>, or <code>third-party</code>.
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>total</code> measures all page resources. <code>document</code> measures HTML document requests.
        <code>other</code> includes XHR or Fetch requests, and data transfers over WebSocket connections.
        <code>third-party</code> measures all resources from third-party domains.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>budget</code></td>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td>Any positive integer.</td>
      <td>The file size limit or resource count limit.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Pass the budget file as a flag {: #flags }

When running Lighthouse from the command line, pass the `--budget-path` (or `--budgetPath`) flag followed by the path to your
budget file in order to calculate whenever a category is over budget.

    lighthouse https://youtube.com --budget-path=./simple-budget.json

Pass the `--output=json` flag followed by `--output-path=./report.json` to save your report results as JSON
in the current working directory.

    lighthouse https://youtube.com --budget-path ./simple-budget.json --output=json --output-path=report.json

If you were to assign your JSON report results to a variable named `report` you could access your
**Keep Request Counts And File Sizes Small** and **Performance Budgets** data from 
`report.audits['resource-summary']` and `report.audits['resource-budget']`, respectively.
